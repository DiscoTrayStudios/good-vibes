# Good Vibes

Web page displaying the Good Vibes mobile app developed by the
team at Disco Tray Studios.

Made by [CloudCannon](http://cloudcannon.com/), the Cloud CMS for Jekyll.

## Develop

Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
